# Task To Do Table!
## Description
In this project I am creating a taskboard that implements a lot more intereactive javascript features including dragging items and creating info to log. 
With this kanban board you can create your own task ,set a due date, and you can drag and drop your tasks in according category to where your status with the task is. It also saves this information to the local storage. Using CSS and javascript I was able to change the colors of the tasks as you move them around the board and implement a datepicker using day js!
